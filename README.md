# My Leet Code Exercises made in Rust

I'm trying to improve my knowledge in Rust by doing some leet code exercises,
I don't plan to put the exercises here to not show the respective answers, BUT
I'll add some tests for each exercise and try to re-arrange them to fit in different
modules.... just for fun.

And I just creat this here to get some GitHub activity as I was doing this only on my machine
